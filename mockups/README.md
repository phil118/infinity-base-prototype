very basic mockups for the infinify base admin presets, all presets are using a copy of the root index.html and the structure should be the same. For now we are commenting out anything that should be conditionally rendered from the configuration settings and loading associated google fonts

compile sass from sass directory using 'gulp' on root.

manually copying output main.css and the variables.scss for that preset into preset folder.
